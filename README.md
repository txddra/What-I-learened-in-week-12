## I learned in week 12, about:
- *"This"*
- *constructors*
- super

   ---

- __*This*__ - is basically something used to reference the thing that was used previous to it. 
  
  `function book(title, author) {
           this.title = title; 
            this.author  = author;`

- __*Constructors*__ - are like regular functions, but are used with the new keyword.
  -it's good practice to capitalize them.

`function Book() {
  // unfinished code
}`

- __*Super*__ :
 is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
